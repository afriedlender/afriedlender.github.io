In this post, we'll be working with data collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The NOAA is an American scientific agency with the United States Department of Commerce that focuses on the conditions of the oceans, major waterways, and the atmosphere. You can read more about this orgnization <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/"> here</a>. 

We have three seperate datasets to work with. The first, **temps.csv**, contains temperature month over month measurments collected from various global stations from the 1930s till 2021. Next, we have two github datasets, which we'll name **stations** and **countries** that we'll join with **temps.csv** to get the data to be displaid by country and region. 

In this post we'll create some visualizations that'll help us address the following three key questions: 

1.  How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?
2.  In a given timeframe, how does change in average temperature vary globally? 
3.  How has global temperature chaged year over year compared to the mid 1900s?



### Importing Data

First, like in any python task, we must import the necessary modules. We'll import the most general ones here and  others later as we need them.

For more detail on pandas, numpy, and matplotlib see my post on  <a href="https://afriedlender.github.io/blog-post-0/"> Creating Python Visualizations using Pandas and Matplotlib</a>.

Here we'll also be importing sqlite3 and plotly.

Sqlite3 is a package we can use to work with databases. It is often best to use databases when working with larger datasets as loading them completely with pandas may take up a lot of memory and computing power.

Plotly, in particular plotly.express, can be used to create more interactive and exciting plots. We'll use plotly here to create map plots.



```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import sqlite3
from plotly import express as px
```

### Creating a Database

As we'll be working with a large amount of data, we should store the data in a databse as to avoid overloading our hardware system. 

First, we must open a connection to a database. When we connect to a pre-existing databse we open it. If we connect to a non-existant database, we will create one.


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") # create a database in current directory called temps.db
```

The first dataset initally resembles a pivot table; it has seperate columns for each month's temperature measurment. Before implementing the data into our databse we will need to reshape it. 


```python
interval = "2011-2020"
url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/decades/{interval}.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

df.head(5)
```

Now, me must clean our data for ease of use later on.

```python
def prepare_df(df):
    """
    This function will take in each subset of the `temps.csv` dataframe.
    It will reshape the data in order to have the following columns:
    ID     Year    Monnth    Temp
        
    """
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)
```

Since our first dataset is so large, we need to input it into a table in our database in smaller chunks.


```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

Lets create a table for the stations data.
```python
stations_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(stations_url)
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

Now, lets make a table for the countries data.

```python
countries_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_url)
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

Lets take a look at the tables in our database.

```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';")

for result in cursor.fetchall():
    print(result[0])
```

    CREATE TABLE "temperatures" (
    "ID" TEXT,
      "Year" INTEGER,
      "Month" INTEGER,
      "Temp" REAL
    )
    CREATE TABLE "stations" (
    "ID" TEXT,
      "LATITUDE" REAL,
      "LONGITUDE" REAL,
      "STNELEV" REAL,
      "NAME" TEXT
    )
    CREATE TABLE "countries" (
    "FIPS 10-4" TEXT,
      "ISO 3166" TEXT,
      "Name" TEXT
    )

Finally, we must close the connection to the databse.

```python
conn.close()
```

## How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?

Let's plot estimates of yearly change collected by the different temperature measuring stations of a given coutry. 

In this example, we'll look at tempuratues of India for all the years of data we have available.

First, let's create a function called `query_climate_database` to query the data that we'll use to plot our map.

This function will take in four explicit arguments:

- `country`, a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned.
- `year_begin / year_end`, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned.
- `month`, an integer giving the month of the year for which should be returned.

```python
def query_climate_database(country,year_begin, year_end, month):
    
    """
    Returns a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, 
    in the specified date range and the specified month of the year.
    """
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.NAME, S.LATITUDE, S.LONGITUDE, 
    C.Name as Country, 
    T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
    FROM temperatures T 
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON substr(T.id, 1, 2) = C."FIPS 10-4"
    WHERE C.Name = "{country}"
    AND T.Year BETWEEN {year_begin} AND {year_end}
    AND T.Month = {month}
    """

    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    return df

query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
```

Now, we'll write a function called `temperature_coefficient_plot()`. This function will accept five explicit arguments, and an undetermined number of keyword arguments.

- `country`, year_begin, year_end, and month should be as in the previous part.
- `year_begin / year_end`, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned.
- `min_obs`, the minimum required number of years of data for any given station. Only data for stations with at least min_obs years worth of data in the specified month will be plotted.
- `kwargs`, additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter_mapbox(). These can be used to control the colormap used, the mapbox style, etc.

To get the estimated yearly temperature, we can compute a custom aggregate using linear regression. We'll use the statistical fact that, when regressing `Temp` against `Year`, the coefficient of `Year` will be an estimate of the yearly change in `Temp`.

Let's make a function for this process.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

```python
def coef(df):
    x = df[["Year"]] # 2 brackets because X should be a df
    y = df["Temp"]   # 1 bracket because y should be a series
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return LR.coef_[0]
```

Now that we have a way to systematically estimate yearly temperatures, let's make our map plot function.

```python
import calendar

def temperature_coefficient_plot(country,year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
  """
  Returns a map of the specified country. Stations that meet the minimun number of observations will be plotted
  and colored according to that stations estimate of yearly temperature change.
  """
    
  # Create a Dataframe with the data to plot 
  df = query_climate_database(country,year_begin, year_end, month)
    
  # Remove stations with fewer than the minimum number of observations
  df = df[df.groupby("NAME")["NAME"].transform("size") >= min_obs]
    
  # Group the data by the relevant fields
  # Add a column containing the estimated yearly temperature change
  coefs = df.groupby(["NAME", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE", "Country"]).apply(coef).reset_index()
  coefs = coefs.rename(columns = {0 : "Estimated Yearly Change (°C)"})
    
  # Round the temperature change appropriately
  rounded_temperatures = coefs["Estimated Yearly Change (°C)"].round(decimals = 4)
  coefs["Estimated Yearly Change (°C)"] = rounded_temperatures
    
  # Create a map plot
  fig = px.scatter_mapbox(coefs, 
                            lat = "LATITUDE",
                            lon = "LONGITUDE",
                            hover_name = "NAME",
                            color = "Estimated Yearly Change (°C)",
                            title = \
                            f"""
                            Estimates of yearly change in termperature in {calendar.month_name[month]}
                            <br>for stations in {country} from {year_begin} to {year_end}""",
                            **kwargs)
    
  return fig


```

Now we can look at the temperature estimates on a map! 

```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

fig.show()

```

## Insert Analysis


## In a given timeframe, how does change in average temperature vary among countries? 

To examine this question, let's make a choropleth map. 

A choropleth map is a type of thematic map in which a set of pre-defined areas is colored or patterned in proportion to a statistical variable that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within each area. You can find more information about choropleth's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map#:~:text=A%20choropleth%20map%20(from%20Greek,each%20area%2C%20such%20as%20population"> here <a>.

To make this choropleth we'll need two things:

1. A data frame containing the temperature variation between our start and end year for each country.
2. A GeoJSON file containing the coordinates for the country polygons.

GeoJSON's are pretty complex files, but fortunately we don't really need to interact with them too much. The code below uses the json module to read a GeoJSON file from the web. This file contains the borders of countries.



```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json

countries_gj_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/countries.geojson"

with urlopen(countries_gj_url) as response:
    countries_gj = json.load(response)
```

Now that we have our GeoJSON file, let's work on getting the data we need to build our plot. 

We'll use a query function to get the basic columns we need. 


```python
def query_climate_database1(year_start, year_end):
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT T.Year, AVG(T.Temp) as Temp, C.Name as Country  
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON substr(T.id, 1, 2) = C."FIPS 10-4"
    WHERE Year BETWEEN {year_start} AND {year_end}
    GROUP BY Year, Country
    """
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    
    return df
```

Let's take a look at the format of the data frame this query function generates.

```python
query_climate_database1(2000, 2020)
```

Now, we'll write a function called `temperature_variation_map()`. This function will accept 2 explicit arguments, and an undetermined number of keyword arguments.

- `year_begin / year_end`, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned.
- `kwargs`, additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter_mapbox(). These can be used to control the colormap used, the mapbox style, etc.


```python
def temperature_variation_map(year_start, year_end, **kwargs):
  """
  Returns a choropleth displaying the difference of global average temperatures by country
  between the user specified years.
  """
    
  df = query_climate_database1(year_start, year_end)
    
  # Create a pivot table in which the columns are years,
  # the indices are countries, and the values are temperature measurments
  df = pd.pivot(df, index = "Country", columns = "Year", values = "Temp").reset_index()
    
  # Create a new column containing the variation in temperature
  df["Variation (°C)"] = (df[year_end] - df[year_start]).round(decimals = 2)
    
  # Modify the dataframe to only contain the country and temperature variation
  df = df[["Country", "Variation (°C)"]].groupby("Country").mean().reset_index()
    
  # Plot the choropleth
  fig = px.choropleth(df, 
                    geojson=countries_gj,
                    locations = "Country",
                    locationmode = "country names",
                    color = "Variation (°C)", 
                    height = 300,
                    title = f"Average temperature change by country from {year_start} to {year_end}.")
    
  fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0, "t": 30,"l":0,"b":0})

Let's take a look at our map!

## Notes to peers

I still need to add comments to most of the second half of the assignment. 

For the last figure, I'm not sure if I'm taking the right approach. I was inspired by the plot in this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-global-temperature-change.html"> article</a>. Essentially my chart isn't telling the same story as the NYT, I'm not seeing as clear of an upward trend in global temperature change. I'm comparing all the global temperature readings against the average global temperature from 1950-1969. 

There could be different issues with my graph:

- My baseline could be off, in which case I want to know what is a good way to estimate what global temperature should be. 
- It could be caused by the fact that I'm taking too many averages, I needed to groupby multiple different dimensions to get a global average. 
- It could also just be due to discrepancies in the number of measurements accross the different stations.
